To build the native sensor modules, first get the project set up in Eclipse so
that the java classes are being compiled. The source code is in src/java

Then make sure that build.local.properties has the correct values in it.

Then run "ant native-sensors" to create the native libraries.

They will be put in ${build.native.dir} which was build/native/lib for
don's installation
