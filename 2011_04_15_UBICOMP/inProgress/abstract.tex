\begin{abstract}

In this paper we describe a system for providing computational assistance with
the aggregation, prediction and validation of distributed, occasionally
available context observations.  We describe our architecture, and a reference
implementation that we test it in real world situations.  We discuss the use,
success and failure cases for this technology.
