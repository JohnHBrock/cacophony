\section{Introduction and Related Work}

The idea of using data flows as perspective from which to manage contextual data
is heavily influenced by work in streaming databases and introduced to the
UbiComp community through the liquid system developed by Heer
et.al.~\cite{HeerNBH03}. Describe liquid.

Is there prior work before liquid?

What has come after liquid?  Does it relate?
